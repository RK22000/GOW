Grocery on Wheels project

This is a prototype for a Grocery Ordering app that was pitched to me.
This app fetches a grocery brochure from firebase and allows the user to make a grocery list.
The list can then be shared with the grocery store through any messenger app like whatsapp that the store is already using to receive orders from customers.
